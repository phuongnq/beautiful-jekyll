# Introduction about Tet

Tet is traditional holiday for Vietnamese. Unlike Gregorian calendar, in Vietnam and some other countries (China, Korea), we celebrate new year with Luna calendar. There are some opinion that we should elimilate Tet holiday and follow Gregorian calendar's new year as most of the world is following. For example, in the past, Japan had celebrated Lunar new year as well but they changed to Gregorian calendar's new year so that it's easier to do businees. The rule is simple: resting when the world is resting and working when the world is working.

For me, as an engineer working in Japan, it is incovenient to take day off to fly back to Vietnam and celebrate Tet holiday while the company is still working as normal. Sometimes, I still have to check group chat messages to make sure there is nothing abnormal happen with the part I take ownership. But still, for me Tet holiday is an special occasion and except in very strict situation, I always flied back Vietnam to join my family for this occasion. And I feel very happy that I could do that most of times since I came to Japan in 2010. The only acception was in 2012, when I had to do the test for graduation and in 2015, when I just changed company and it was difficult to take holiday (We were doing startup stuff and I didn't feel good to take day off, and an other reason is, in that year my parent came to Japan to join Gregorian calendar's new year). In October last year, I changed company again but still got holiday just in time to fly back Vietnam. So lucky for me :). In the future I will still keep this tradition as much as possible, maybe until we change to celebrate new year in Gregorian calendar.

So to introduce Tet holiday, there are some typical things Vietnamese do:

* First of all, for last few days of ending year, we do cleaning to make sure everything is new, ready for new year coming. Sometimes I feel people are too tired of cleaning :). This maybe a negative thing for new year since it should be the time resting, instead of doing more stuffs. But still, people are excited about new year that it seems ok to do that much work (but not for me lol). My suggestion is that while keeping the tradition, we should take it easy to be more relaxing while do year ending shopping or cleaning.

* The evening of 30th November (Luna calendar), we call it **Giao thua** which means the changing season from old year to a new year. We usually have firework for *Giao thua* and every family has a table of fruits with a whole chicken to worship the ancestors. Young people tend to go out for firework but I would like to rest at home lol. For me, my tradition is to stay at home, go out at midnight and back home to be first guest of my house. It is important who is the first guest of each house because we believe that right person would bring good luck the whole year. I believe in myself so I do the whole time for my family :). And as an other my-tradition, it is more important that I spend time with who, than where. In the recent years, there is also a TV show **Tao quan** most families would watch together as a new tradition. Thought, there are some opinion that this TV show should end it life after 15 years of broadcasting for a new TV show.

* The official holiday would be in three days of new year. In these days, people try to go to relatives, friends to greeting and doing parties. This is very nice occassion to maintain relationship with your friends or colleagues. There would be also lucky money for children as well.

# My thought

As a tradition for myself, I take time at home to watch *Tao quan* with my family and thinking about new year coming. I also have my own resolution for each year but this year is the first time I post to my blog. This year, while browsing the internet I found out an interesting quote and that motivated me to write this post:

> One thing you can't recycle is wasted time

As far as current of 2018, when we still cannot manipulate time, it is limited resource. And it is so true that we cannot recycle wasted time. I reminded what my professor at Keio University said that *"when you guys graduated, begin to work, time would be fly faster. And soon you guys would be come old men"* lol. This is so true.

So I just wanted to note to myself how fast time fly is, and it is critical to decide what I need to do until my end of life. I'm not a fan of *Steve Job* as well, but I like his quote:

> Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything â€” all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.

For the new year coming, I would like to follow my heart and do everything I can :).

And finally, for new year resolution, this year I would like to master the skill of quickly taking action when unexpected things happen. For me, I could do kind of anything with prepared time. It is strong point that I am willing to learn new thing, and do much preparation, have some plan beforehand. But this also leads to a weak point that when unexpected thing happen, it takes time for me to think clearly and take appropriated action. Recently I realize that this skill is critical and make huge different in life. And for that reason, I am making plan to work on this.

It's almost new year now, I would like to say **HAPPY NEW YEAR!!** to everyone reaching the end of this post :). Hope you have a new year with joy, happiness and make sure to use your time cleverly :).
