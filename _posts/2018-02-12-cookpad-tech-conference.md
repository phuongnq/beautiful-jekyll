**Cookpad** Inc is a tech company about food. They have plan to expand to more businesses but right now, the main business is [cookpad.com](https://cookpad.com). Their mission is to *make everyday cooking fun!* 

In [cookpad.com](https://cookpad.com), they provide receipes to cook in multiple languages and regions. Their main monetize method is to provide premeum users with some benefits compare to normal users. An other note about their global expanation is that they use same domain *cookpad.com* for all regions. For example: https://cookpad.com/us for USA, https://cookpad.com/id for Indonesia, https://cookpad.com/vn for Vietnam and so on.

In 10th February, 2018, *Cookpad* organized anual tech conference for 2018. Main method to get a ticket is from [connpass](https://cookpad.connpass.com/event/73971/). The ticket is provided randomly so we need a little luck to take part in the event. There is also a get-together party after the conference so make sure to check both if you are going to register for a ticket next year!

They will prove slides and blog posts about this conference so make sure to check their [Twitter Cookpad Tech Life account](https://twitter.com/cookpad_tech).

The talks were kind of typical conference for a tech conference with speeds about many topics such as: keynote speeds by CTO and other executive, talk about how company do project, automation test, design, work flow, AI technology about image processing. Other than that, there were talks about *cookpad storeTV* - a new service which cookpad used hardware for the first time; Lifestyle Product Award with prize was 300,000 JPY and introduction of new C to C service which would be soon release this spring. Here are some note and my thought about the conference as well as Cookpad company:

* *Cookpad* is a tech company and they are positively contribue to open source community. Check out their [Github page](https://github.com/cookpad).

* Their main programming language is *Ruby* and they are using *Ruby on Rails* as primary framework. And actually, they have the [World's Largest Rails Monolith](https://speakerdeck.com/a_matsuda/the-recipe-for-the-worlds-largest-rails-monolith). But recently, they are refactoring to use micro services so it is possible to use or backend languages such as *Rust*, *Golang*. 

* As a [new Ruby committer joined the company](https://info.cookpad.com/en/pr/news/press_2017_0123), there are 2 Ruby committers in *Cookpad Inc* now. I think this would make their technical part stronger. And this is one of the evident that *Cookpad* is a tech company.

* There were many new graduated or just graduated 1 year as speekers. Suprisingly those speakers presentation skill is very good. They are all engineers and presented with clear speak, lound enough voice and made impressive to the audiences.

As one of my friend is working at *Cookpad Inc*, I had a chance to take a quick check their office.
