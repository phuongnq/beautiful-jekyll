Recently, I've read a Japanese book with title [Google流疲れない働き方](https://books.rakuten.co.jp/rb/15306289/), which means `Working without fatigue like Google`. At the same time, I have an interesting discussion with some old colleagues about working styles. So I decided to write a post about **working smart** vs **working hard**. This is just a note for myself, not purposing to give any advice to anyone!

# Introduction about the book

This book has interesting chapters' titles

> Changing from managing your time to manage your concentration

or

> Managing your energy and emotion

Other chapters talk about how we should eat, sleep, working without fatigue so kind of normal content. I only concentrated to read above 2 chapters. They gave me some new concepts about managing concentration, energy and emotion. Actually, we have a lot of materials in the Internet about advising like we have to manage our time to get great achivements. That we should not waste time playing game, do stupid things, but use time to do more work, do more meaning tasks like learning new skills. People who advise this often forget about one important fact:

> **Spending more time to work or learn does not mean we will get more achivements. It depends on how concentrated we are and, do we have enough energy to complete the task?**

So I realised that instead of managing my time (of course, still, we should do that^^!), it is more important to manage my concentration. In fact, if we are more concentrated, we can complete a task with more accuracy and in less time. I've tested with my daily work and very happy with what I could archive: I spend morning time to implement most difficult tasks, afternoon to just checking, adding document or taking part in meetings, discussion with teammates. Until now, everything is going great: no or little bugs fix, highly evaluated by teammates about schedules and I'm feeling that I could see the overall picture of the project, confident about deadline, etc.

# Working smart vs working hard

So back to the main subject about **working smart** vs **working hard**!

As a background, I studied in Japan for half of my 4 years university in Japan and graduated here. After that, I'm working in Japan or Japanese companies up to 6 years now. That to say, Japanese working style affected me a lot. To talk about traditional Japanese working style, they prefer to work many hours. This is so different from my home country, where people often work only for enough 8 hours a day and enjoy time with friends and family. This is not to say Japanese working style is bad. Actually, they could archive great success by that style. But at the same time, as from my experience, Japanese people tend to work long hours but they are not working that hard. They could archive similar goal in less time by being more concentrated. But anyway, it is traditional working style here. So that explains for the reason why they could work for long hours.

At the same time, there are many people advise you to work harder and harder. If you are not deeply thinking about it, just work like crazy, you may fall in the trap of working more but archive less. In my software engineering industry, there are many examples for this opinion:

* You work hard in **many trivial tasks** but not well evaluated from your managers. They evaluated someone else who could solve **a difficult problem**.

* You work hard on writing/doing more test cases but you could create an automation test which implemented one time but use for many times.

* Your code is not optimized so you have to work hard with extra time to maintain it.

* You do not spend enough time to investigate best practice, jump right away into implementation. And when released to production, you released that the architecture was bad designed and have to spend extra extra time to fix it.

And from my experience, some engineers who seem to have a lot of space time often:

* Have a bigger picture about the project

* Could solve difficult problem

* Have time to think about automation, improvement

* Get highly evaluation, receive tags like MVP, MIP, etc.

In my opinion, they work smart like that because they can effectively manage their concentration, energy and emotion. So whenever you have to work hard, think about it again! Find a solution to work smarter. And always try to become a professional who do not always look like very busy. By working hard, you could be average but by working smart, you could archive great goal. There are many learning materials about working smart in the Internet, just try Google or Quora it.

The story may be different if you want to start your own business: you may have to work smart first, then work hard base on that smart!
