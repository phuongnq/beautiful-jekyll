In [previous post](https://phuongnq.me/2018-01-27-web-scraper-with-nextjs/), I introduced how to use *NextJS* to build a website scraper. The demo was using a boilerplate with ExpressJS and bootstrap. Bootstrap is nice and quick way to write admin tool or prototype but is not a good solution for production.

For production web, it is better to use **Material Design** with responsive possibility.

There is already *React* package for *Material Design* as in [this link](http://www.material-ui.com/#/). They also provide a simple example for how to use *material-ui* with *NextJS* in [here](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/tree/v1-beta/examples/nextjs).

Inspired of that, I combined the original boilerplate with material ui support.

I created a boilerplate and public to Github: [https://github.com/phuongnq/nextjs-material-design-boilerplate](https://github.com/phuongnq/nextjs-material-design-boilerplate)

In the future, I am planning to add more to this boilerplate and use for any new project from now on.
